DaemonSets: Create or update DaemonSets to run a copy of a pod on every node or a subset of nodes.
Jobs: Create or update Jobs to run pods for completing a specific task.
CronJobs: Create or update CronJobs to run a job at a specific time.
It's important to keep in mind that some resources may have dependencies on others, such as a pod depending on a PVC for storage. Therefore, it's always a good practice to first create the resources that other resources depend on before creating the dependent resources.

Also when updating resources, you should be aware of the order of update, it's always safer to update a resource that has a lower dependency first, and then updating the resources that depend on it.
